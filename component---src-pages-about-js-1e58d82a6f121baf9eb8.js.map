My name is Vinicius Ortega and almost graduated in civil\n          engineering. I like messing around with computers since I was litte,\n          doing hardware fixing and some simple software maintenance . I started\n          programming back in 2016 in C language at university and no surprise\n          really enjoyed it.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Later in 2021 I decided to start learning a modern language, because\n          back in time I really liked C language classes. I learned Java and did\n          some projects, this time I got hooked by it and started as a hobby,\n          programming every day. Than I meet the <span>world </span>of web\n          development and kept learning until now.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I hope my projects can be viewed at different places in the{\" \"}\n          <span>globe</span>, I’ll be updating my portfolio to improve it and\n          check my knowledge progress.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"footer-about\">\n        <span>©2021.
